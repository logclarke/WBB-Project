Steps:

1. Move the current iteration of “practiceBoxScore.csv” to the “old” folder and add the date it was edited to the file name.
2. Move the current iteration of “practiceDataRaw.xlsx” to the “old” folder and add the date it was edited to the file name (I redownload it, save it adding the date last edited, put that in the "old" folder, and then delete the current iteration).
3. Save the file Hailey sends as “practiceDataRaw.xlsx” into the “practiceBYU” folder.
4. Run “cleanPracticeData.R”.
