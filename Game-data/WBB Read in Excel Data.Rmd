Creating csv files for the cumulative total
```{r}
data_ref <- "/Users/loganclarke/Documents/WBB Project/WBBGame stats.xlsx"

excel_sheets(path = data_ref)

#extract only the week total tabs
cumulative <- grep("Cumulative Season Results", excel_sheets(path = data_ref), value = TRUE)

cum_clean <- read_excel(path = data_ref, sheet = cumulative)

#create clean dataset in the right order
clean_week <- function(week){
  week <- data.frame(week)
  week1 <- week[c(2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13:16, 18, 19, 21, 23, 24, 26:28, 30:32, 34, 36)]
  week2 <- week1[c(1, 2, 12, 11, 13, 18, 17, 19, 15, 14, 16, 21, 20, 22, 9, 10, 8, 4, 6, 7, 5, 23, 3)]
  write_csv(week2, "cum_total_21_dec.csv")
}

clean_week(cum_clean)
```





Appendix
```{r}
#use this if reading in a bunch of tabs
#list_all <- lapply(clean_tabs, function(x) read_excel(path = data_ref, sheet = x))

#this was the way to create dynamic variable names. Just couldn'f figure out how to store them as a list
# week <- 0
# 
# week[[i]] <- week1 <- data.frame(list_all[[i]])
# 
# assign(paste0("week", 1), list_all[[1]])
# 
# week11
# 
# for(i in 1:length(list_all)) {
#   assign(paste0("week_", i), list_all[[i]])
#   
# }
