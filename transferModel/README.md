From Melanie:

"We are open to any conference. We are specifically looking for a point guard and a big who can score in low post, but if there is a wing or a 4 player who is a program changer, we are open to that as well."

As of now we have just a general ranking metric. We may need to do something more specific to identify this specific post player request.

Note for filtering the transfer portal:

In the transfer, players with the red triangle don't want to be contacted, so filter them out. Probably need to manually do that.
